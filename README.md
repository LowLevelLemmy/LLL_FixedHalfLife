LLL's Fixed Half life!
======================

I used https://github.com/Solokiller/halflife-updated

To install this mod all you do is download the release and put it in your Half Life Directory. For example `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life`. Restart steam and it should appear. You can enjoy throwing peanut brittle and fighting true vortigons. But you really shouldn't play it. It was just for a video I made on [LLL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYwRPV5Wi6C00HE3Yl2Qlqg/featured)
